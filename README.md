# 📊 COVID-19 Insights India – Tableau Dashboard

This repository contains a comprehensive Tableau dashboard project that visualizes the COVID-19 situation across India. It includes insightful visualizations based on vaccination statistics, testing data, and state-wise case distributions. The aim of this project is to turn raw COVID-19 datasets into meaningful and interactive visuals that help users easily understand the pandemic trends in India.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on:
- State-wise COVID-19 testing and case statistics
- First vs. second dose vaccination trends
- Age group-based dose administration
- Vaccine-wise dose distribution (Covaxin, CoviShield, Sputnik V)
- Map-based visualization of total deaths across Indian states

The dashboards are designed for clarity, interactivity, and to provide real-time understanding of the situation during the pandemic.
